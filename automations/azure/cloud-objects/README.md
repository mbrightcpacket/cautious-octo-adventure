# Find Azure resource IDs

This script will find the Azure resource IDs for items related to the Azure Function app.
It is used mainly for debugging purposes.

Once a resource ID is found, the Bicep code for the resource can be imported into VS Code by using the ['Bicep: Insert Resource' commmand palette item](/static-assets/bicep-insert-resource.png).
