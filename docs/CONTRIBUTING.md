Each script or automation should be contained in an enclosing directory with accompanying `README.md` and any related diagrams.

The file and directory layout is arbitrarily subject to change, so use [permalinks][permalinks] to refer to specific files.

## Text and Documentation

- Markdown files should comply with the [CommonMark Markdown specification][commonmark] using the [markdown-it] library, as is done in [VS Code][vscode].
- Prose sentences should exist one per line, so as to make diff'ing easier.
  For instance,

    ```text
    This is the first sentence. And this is the second one.
    ```
  
  ... should be written in the markdown file as:

    ```text
    This is the first sentence.
    And this is the second one.
    ```

## Bash scripts

- Any Bash scripts must pass [shellcheck][shellcheck].
- Formatting of Bash scripts should comply with the following use of [shfmt][shfmt]:

    ```bash
    shfmt -i 4 -w script.sh
    ```

## Terraform

Terraform scripts and modules should be formatted according to:

```bash
terraform fmt
```
