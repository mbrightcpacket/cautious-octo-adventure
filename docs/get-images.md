# Copy the appliances into your Azure subscription

Before deploying the cPacket cCloud appliances, they must be copied into your Azure subscription.

1. Obtain the appliance URL file from cPacket (default name `ccloud-urls.txt`).
1. Open the Azure cloud shell.
1. Upload it to the Azure cloud shell.
1. Download and execute the `ccloud-azure-images` script.

## Obtain the appliance URLs file

Contact cPacket Networks to obtain the appliance URLs file.
This file contains the Shared Access Signature (SAS) URLs of the appliances.

### Open the Azure cloud shell

In the Azure portal, open the Azure cloud shell by clicking on the icon in the upper right corner of the Azure portal.

### Upload the file containing the appliance URLs

Upload this `ccloud-urls.txt` file to the Azure cloud shell.
(The root directory of the cloud shell is expected, and it is the default upload location.)

### Create the images

The `ccloud-azure-images` script will create the images in your Azure subscription using the URLs provided in `ccloud-urls.txt`.

If you are creating a new resource group with a default name, you can pipe the script directly through the shell as the following invocation:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mbrightcpacket/cautious-octo-adventure/main/ccloud-azure-images | bash
```

This creates a new resource group with a name such as `cpacket-ccloud-abc123` in the `eastus2` region.

Instead, if you have an existing resource group or would like to create the resource group with a specific name, first download the script and then supply it with the name of your resource group.

Download the script:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mbrightcpacket/cautious-octo-adventure/main/ccloud-azure-images > ccloud-azure-images
```

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x ccloud-azure-images
```

Run it:

```bash
./ccloud-azure-images -g resource-group-name
```

After executing the script, you should have new resources in your resource group corresponding to the cCloud appliances in the URL file above:
